### Antivirus Considerations

Some antivirus software may flag PyInstaller-generated executables as potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). This is a false positive common with many Python applications bundled with PyInstaller.

**If flagged**:
1. Verify download from official source
2. Add to antivirus whitelist
3. Consider building from source

### Verification

For security-conscious users:
1. Download source code
2. Build your own executable using provided scripts
3. Compare checksums with provided hashes (when available)

## Support

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Check `docs/` folder for detailed guides
2. **Issues**: Report problems via project issue tracker
